'''The issue you're encountering with not creating the files docker file downwads  is likely related to how the os.path.split() function handles file paths and the logic that follows for creating directories and files. When you include files like Dockerfile, setup.py, etc., which are intended to be created at the root level (i.e., without any directories), os.path.split() returns an empty string for the directory name. This may cause issues in the directory creation logic.

Why the Error Occurs:
os.path.split(path):
This function splits the path into a directory (folder_name) and a file (file_name).
For paths like "Dockerfile", os.path.split("Dockerfile") returns ('', 'Dockerfile'), meaning folder_name is an empty string.
Directory Creation Logic:
The script attempts to create directories only when folder_name is not empty. This works well for files inside directories but fails when dealing with root-level files like Dockerfile or setup.py.


Solution:
We need to ensure that the script correctly handles root-level files. Specifically, it should skip directory creation for such files but still proceed to file creation.
Ensuring Proper File Creation:
we just do  if folder_name which is same as if folder_name !='':

    logger.info(f"error in Created file and folders : {folder_name}")
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'info'

The error you're encountering is due to an incorrect use of the logging module. Specifically, the logging.basicConfig function doesn't return a logger object; instead, it configures the root logger. As a result, when you attempt to call logger.info(...), you're actually calling info() on a NoneType object because logger is not a logger object.

Solution
You should create a logger object explicitly using logging.getLogger() after configuring it with logging.basicConfig. Here's how you can modify your script to fix the issue:

#SETUP AND REQUIREMENTS
'''Issues and Fixes:
Format of requirements.txt:

Ensure that the requirements.txt file does not have any trailing commas or invalid entries. For example, setuptools, and -e . should not have trailing 
commas or be improperly formatted.
Handling -e .:

The -e . entry in requirements.txt is used for editable installs and should be handled carefully. It is not required to be in the install_requires
 list when using setup.py directly. The -e . entry should be handled separately if you want to include local development dependencies.
 If you need to include the local package (-e .) in development, consider installing it separately using pip in editable mode: as follows: 
 pip install -e .

'''3. Run Your Script Correctly

When running a script that imports modules from your package, you should run the script from the parent directory of Hate_classification (i.e., the directory that contains Hate_classification). Here’s how you should do it:

Navigate to the Parent Directory:cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\/nlp_text_class
Run Your Script Using the -m Flag:

This allows Python to correctly resolve module imports relative to the package structure: python -m Hate_classification.LOGGERS.logging
Explanation: this worked

-m flag tells Python to run a module as a script.
Hate_classification.LOGGERS.logging specifies the module path.

## data processing methods 
'''
When apply() is used on a DataFrame:
It applies the function to each column (the default, axis=0).
If you want to apply it to each row instead, you would specify axis=1.
